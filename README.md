# Things to do :

1)Implement response time for processes;

2)Implement priority of processes;

3)Implement average response time;

4)Implement other schedule algorithms // Round -Robin & Shortest Job Remaning && Priority Scheduling;

# Things that can and should be done yet they're not our top priority:
- Keep track of active proceses;
- Keep track of CPU utilisation ( in % , prosposition : active process gives CPU 100% , no active process 0% , that simple .)
- Make software run each type of schedules and show table of differences between schedule algorithms;
- Create visuals for software;
